   <!-- 
        The blue highlited words are called properties 
    -->
     <!--
         what will happen to button when we click the button."active" is also a pseudo-class 
        -->
        <!-- The opacity value range between 0 to 1-->
        <!--
          transition property is used in style rather than hover cause when used in hover it just take place while we hover the cursor 
           in the button not while hovering back WE CAN ADD TRANSITION ON MULTIPLE PROPERTIES  BY FOOLOWING Name__hoveringtime, Name__hovering time-->
        <!-- 
            to add shadow box-shadow horizontal pos_ vertical pos_blur_color
        
             rgba basically red green blue opacity(bw 0 to 1)
        -->
        <!--
            Hex is basically 1a2b3c first two represent red
           
             sim 2nd two green and last two blue 
             to convert hex to rgb use any hex to rgb calculator onn internet-->



        <!-- Defining of height and width  of  button is not
           recommended as it forces the button to follow the defined value
  
           rather adjusting it wrt to the length and size of text 
          
           so we define spacing inside the button which is called padding       -->
           <!--
            CSS box model 
            it basically determines 
          
              how much space an element takes up 
              how  far it is away from other elements

           
           by default browser align things by aligning text 
          to align the unaligned buttons we use vertica;l align
        
          SINCE WE USE HTML CSS JAVASCIPT TO MAKE WEBPAGES
          WE STORE CSS AND JS TO ANOTHER FILE AND 

          THEN USE "LINK TAG " TO LINK THE CSS AND JS FILE TO HTML FILE
        
        LINK TAG IS USED IN HEAD TAG
        IT IS A VOID ELEMENT i.e. it dont need a closing tag
        
        LINK Tag has 3 attributes
        1. rel: it defines the relationship between the current document and the linked document
        2. href: it defines the path to the linked document
        3. type: it defines the media type of the linked document
         

        SYNTAX:
        <link rel = "file type" href = "path to file" type = "media type" >
         
        path to file format 
        folder/folder/file.extension

        media type format
        text/css


        eg: <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "buttons.css" type >
        example containing all 3 attributes
        is <link rel = "stylesheet" href = "buttons.css" type = "text/css" >
