  text Elements - element that is inside a line of text 
   strong : it makes text bold 
   u: makes text underlined 
   span: most generic element with no styles 
    
   WE CAN DEFINE A CLASS TO THE any text ele ELEMENT AND ADD OUR OWN STYLES

  <!--
    to add MULTIPLE spacing between lines
    we use the MARGIN PROPERTY .

    as in html multiple spaces are ignored to a single space
    so we use margin property to add multiple spaces between lines
