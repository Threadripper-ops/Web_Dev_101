 <!-- 
  postion in css is used to position elements in a webpage
  1. static: default value
 
  2. relative: it is relative to its normal position i.e if we give top: 20px
            it will move 20px from its normal position
  
  3. fixed: it makes the element to float above the webpage i.e its postion 
            wont change even if we scroll
            here elements is placed abve the page or in the browser window

  4. absolute: it places elements relative to its parent element i.e if we give top: 20px
            it will move 20px from its parent element      
            here elements is placed on the page so it moves when we scroll





             top and bottom are used to move the element vertically basically it sets width 
             from the top and bottom of the parent element
             similarly left and right are used to move the element horizontally basically it sets width
              from the left and right of the parent element

              and if we give top and bottom or left and right both then the element will be stretched


              also depending on use case we can use height and width or top ,bottom and left-right 
              i.e. if we want to move the elwment with the parent element then we use top,bottom,left,right
              and if we want to make the elwment fixed then we use height and width






              Z-index: it is used to set the order of the elements i.e. which element will be on top
              by default the order is set by the order of the elements in the html file


              elements with higher z-index will appear in front of elements w
              with lower z-index.
